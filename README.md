# API-Data-Standardization-Practice

The goal of this project was to use a provided link to fetch an API and standardize the information provided. Further description of the requirements is shown below.

The main objective for this coding challenge is to send an API request to a server, get the data, then build a solution after getting the data.

Here's the server address: https://ct-api-challenge.herokuapp.com/

Use the API key with the server address to pull in your data. The data is a collection of partners who need to attend meetings within their respective countries. For each partner the goal is to find first and last names, email addresses, country locations and dates of availability.

The job is to build an invitation list based on the data.
